# stochastic-processes
Assignments, Slides and presentations in Stochastic Processes taught by Dr. Jahed Motlagh at IUST

## Contents
You can find explanation in each folder. In this section, there is just summary of each work folder:

### Presentations
You can find my presentations in this course about Characteristic Functions, Covariance Functions of Recursive Systems, Law of Large Numbers and Poisson Random Variable and Processes.

### Project
In this work, some properties of random variables and processes have been shown, such as:
* Constructing colored noise from white noise
* Demonstrating stationary features of some random processes
* Law of large numbers and central limit theorem
* Power spectral density

## Acknowledgment
I have used many contents from different websites which I have not referenced! I have bookmarked all those references and I will update the slides or at least provide the links at each folder.

## Course Content
Slides can be shared upon request. Please send me an email (available on [nikronic.github.io](nikronic.github.io) or if you could not find it, contact me by creating an issue.
Videos are also available but it is really hard for me as I have to download about 30 2h sessions and then upload it somewhere else (do not know direct upload to cloud works or not - if you know any solution, please fill free to contact me and I will for sure try that).
